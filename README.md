    - type `git rebase branch_name`
    - if conflicts  reslove it and ` git rebase --continue`.

    - if you push the new brnach which will show right away on github
    - in case you created on pull request and merged it. and in the same branch you made changes want to create pull request 
        it will n't show up but you can navigate to pull request tab & create it.
